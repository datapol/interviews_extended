# Strangulation

From [**Down Girl**](https://smile.amazon.com/Down-Girl-Misogyny-Kate-Manne-ebook/dp/B075KHQKM3/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0)

Women who are ***strangled*** rarely cooperate with the police ([Resnick 2015](https://rewire.news/article/2015/04/23/sexual-assault-cases-prosecutors-look-method-control/)).

Often incorrectly called [**choking**,](#choking)” non-fatal manual ***strangulation*** is inherently dangerous.
It can lead to death hours, days, even weeks afterward
due to complications from the brain being deprived of oxygen.

It also causes injuries to the throat that may not leave a mark
([Snyder 2015](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-unseen-victims-of-traumatic-brain-injury-from-domestic-violence)).
If you don’t know how to examine a victim’s throat,
what to look for in her eyes (red spots, called “petechiae”),
and the right questions to ask, it may seem no harm has come of it 
([Strack 1999](http://www.ncdsv.org/images/strangulation_article.pdf))

The matter will often go no further.
She may not seek medical treatment.
The incident will be “shrouded in silence”
([Dotson 2011, 244](https://www.academia.edu/21792077/Curious_Disappearances_Affectability_Imbalances_and_Process-Based_Invisibility)).
Sometimes, she won’t wake up the next morning, or some morning hence.
Moreover, victims of a non-fatal attack of this kind have also been found to be some
seven times more likely to become the victim of an attempted homicide by the same perpetrator
([Strack, McClane, and Hawley 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0736467901003997)),
Yet many states in America do not have
a specific statute making strangulation a crime
(relegating it to a simple assault; typically a misdemeanor) (Turkel 2008).

## Choking
Whereas choling involves an internally obstructed airway -
people may choke on a foreign object, such as a pice of food -
strangulation is caused by external pressure exerted on the throat or neck,
resulting in "one or all of the following:
  * blocking of the carotid arteries (depriving the brain of oxygen),
  * blocking of the jugular veind (preventing deocygenated blood from exiting the brain),
  * closing off the airway, causing the victim to be unable to breathe" (Turkel 2008).

It requires very little pressure (around 11 pounds) to block the carotid arteries,
and unconsciousness may occur within seconds;
brain death within minutes.

As a basis for comparison, almost twice as much pressure (around 20 punds)
needs to be exerted to open a soda can.
