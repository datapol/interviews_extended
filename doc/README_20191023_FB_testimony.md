# [Facebook CEO Testimony Before House Financial Services Committee](https://www.c-span.org/video/?465293-1/facebook-ceo-testimony-house-financial-services-committee)    
October 23, 2019

## Zuckerberg Opening Remarks
* More than a billion people throughout the world who don't have access to a bank account
  but could through mobile phones if the right system existed.
  That includes 14 million people in America
* People wait far too long to send money home to their families abroad
* The idea behind Libra is Sending money should be as easy as sending a message
* Risks:
  * Financial stability
  * Terrorism
* Libra will be backed mostly by (US) dollars
* Helped to found the Libra Association, a coalition to 21 companies and non-profits.
  * Libra association is independent (from Facebook) and we don't control it

### Promise
"""FB will not be a part of launching the Libra payment system anywhere in the world, even outside the US,
  until the US regulators approve.

30:00 until we have full support of US regulatiors

Caveats:
  * FB will not be part, but what other Zuckerberg thing will?
  * Maloney asks which regulators?
  * Z didn't say "all" US regulators

### Civil Rights and Diversity
* As part of a settlement with Civil Rights groups, we've banned advertisers
  from using age, gender, or zip codes 
  to target housing, employment or credit opportunities.
  And we've limited interest-based targetting for these ads too.
  This is part of our commitment to support Civil Rights and prevent discrimination.

* 21:00 Diversity leads to better decisions and better services for our community
  * Within 5 years more than 50% of our workforce will be women, people of color, and other under-represented groups.
